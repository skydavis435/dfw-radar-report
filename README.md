# dfw-radar-report
R markdown used to make reproducible PDF reports for wildlife managers at DFW airport.

Utilizing data from an advanced bird tracking radar at DFW, automatic daily reports are generated with metrics that were useful for DFW personnel. 

Reporting archive was leveraged to backfill the reporting archive so that radar trends could be examined throughout the duration of the deployment.
